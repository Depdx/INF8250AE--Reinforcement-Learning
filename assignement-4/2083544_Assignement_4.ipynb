You are **not allowed** to discuss the problems with other students.\n","* Part of this assignment will be autograded by gradescope. You can use it as immediate feedback to improve your answers. You can resubmit as many times as you want.\n","* All your solution, code, analysis, graphs, explanations should be done in this same notebook.\n","* Please make sure to execute all the cells before you submit the notebook to the gradescope. You will not get points for the plots if they are not generated already.\n","* Please **do not** change the random seeds\n","* Please start early. Some of the experiments take a lot of time to run on CPU.\n","* If you have questions regarding the assignment, you can ask for clarifications on Piazza. You should use the corresponding tag for this assignment.\n","* The deadline for submitting this assignment is **10:00 PM on Sunday,** **November 26, 2023**\n","---\n","---\n","\n","This assignment has 4 parts.

Environment\n","\n","For this assignment, we will use  [`CartPole-v1`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) from OpenAI Gymnasium. In this environment, the goal is to balance an inverted pendulum on a cart by moving the cart laterally. The state of the agent has four components:\n","\n","- The horizontal position of the cart, $x$\n","- The velocity of the cart, $\\dot{x}$\n","- The angle of the pendulum, measured relative to the vertical axis, $\\theta$\n","- The angular velocity of the pendulum, $\\dot\\theta$\n","\n","There are two actions in the action space:\n","- 0: push cart to the left\n","- 1: push cart to the right\n","\n","The agent receives a reward of $1$ at each timestep, and the episode ends when the pendulum drops too far ($|\\theta|$ is more than $12^o$) or when the cart goes out of bounds. Also, the environment truncates after 500 steps if it hasn't already terminated, so the greatest possible return is $200$."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Wn8e5oDkOIVQ"},"source":["# Part 0.
